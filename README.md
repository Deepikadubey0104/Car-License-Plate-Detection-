# Car-License-Plate-Detection-

### Project Overview
This project implements a complete Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline for extracting vehicle license plate numbers using PaddleOCR

### Objectives
Train text recognition models for license plate reading
Compare performance between PPOCR v4 and PPOCR v5
Visualize training metrics and inference results
Build a complete production-ready OCR pipeline

PPOCR (PaddlePaddle OCR) is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolkit developed by PaddlePaddle.
It is designed to detect and recognize text from images efficiently and accurately.

PPOCR is a system that can:
Find text inside an image
Read the text
Convert it into digital text
